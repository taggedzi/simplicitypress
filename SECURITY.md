# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the **latest released version** of SimplicityPress.

Older versions may not receive security updates. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the most recent release when possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately using one of the following methods:

- GitHub **Security Advisories** (preferred, if enabled)
- Email the project maintainer (see repository profile)

Please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code

You may redact sensitive information as needed.

## Disclosure Process

Once a report is received:

1. The issue will be reviewed and validated
2. A fix will be developed and tested
3. A patched release will be published
4. A security advisory may be issued if appropriate

We aim to respond to security reports in a timely manner, but response times may vary depending on complexity and availability.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The SimplicityPress core library
- CLI and GUI interfaces
- Official release artifacts

Third-party dependencies are subject to their own security policies.
