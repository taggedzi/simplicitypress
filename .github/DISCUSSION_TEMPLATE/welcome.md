Thanks for starting a discussion! 🙌

**Pick a good category** (Q&A, Ideas, Show and tell, etc.) and include:

- What you’re trying to do
- What you expected vs what happened (if something went wrong)
- Your OS (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- CLI/GUI/API (if relevant)
- Any logs or screenshots (redact secrets)

If you think you found a bug, consider opening a **Bug report** issue instead.
